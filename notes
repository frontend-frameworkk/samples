typescript follows object oriented fundamentals

typescript is a superset of javascript

typecript latest features
1)strong typing - 
not required to mention type of varaible like we mention type in java and .net
2)object oriented features - typescript provides few object oriented features which we have missed in javascript.
3)compile time errors - we can errors at compile time than runtime , of-course not all errors but max errors,
 der is a compilation step involved for code,can fix those errors before deploying and run the code,
4)great tooling - we csn access to great tools , intelisense we get in code editor

typecript -> transpile ->javascript (browser can understand)

C:\Users\Venkat Enjam\ts-samples> tsc main.ts  //to transpile the ts to js
>ls  // you will have 2 files
main.js main.ts
code main.js  // will take you the editor of main.js file

in angular when you call ng serve
angular cli will call transpiler under the hood , we need to transpile manually


we have es5 which is supported by all the browsers
es6(2015)
es2016
es2017 so on ...
